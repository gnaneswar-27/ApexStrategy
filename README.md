# ApexStrategy
Machine Learning–Driven Formula 1 Strategy & Race Outcome Simulator

ApexStrategy is an end-to-end machine learning project that combines Formula 1 race data, predictive modeling, and strategy analysis to estimate podium probability and visualize tire degradation behavior using an interactive Streamlit application.

The Streamlit app allows users to:

- Select starting grid position
- Choose tire compound
- Adjust stint length (with realistic limits)
- Visualize tire degradation curves
- See predicted podium probability (%)


Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```
